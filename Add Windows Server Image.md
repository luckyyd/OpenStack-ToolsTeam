Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard Evaluation for OpenStack

##Overview

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckyyd/OpenStack-ToolsTeam/master/res/Add-Windows-Server-Image-1.png)

Windows® Cloud Images are a great way for you to rapidly deploy pre-packaged, fully supported OpenStack™ Windows Guests, including the required support for hypervisor specific drivers (Hyper-V / KVM). Also integrated are the guest initialization tools (Cloudbase-Init™), security updates, proper performance and security configurations as well as the final Sysprep. Our aim is to guarantee you the maximum cloud deployment quality, but also to make sure that customers won’t need to spend resources on dedicated Windows DevOps for managing Windows workloads and assisting clients.


##Supported Hypervisors
All the images come with the required hypervisor specific drivers and tools, for example VirtIO for KVM.

• Hyper-V
